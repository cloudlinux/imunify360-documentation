If some websites fail to scan try to increase this value. It is limited by 1GB.</li><li><strong>Number of days to keep…</strong> It configures antivirus to keep backup versions of cleaned files. During this period you can restore these files back using “Undo” button.</li><li><strong>Trim malicious files instead of deleting it</strong> It configures antivirus do not delete files when malware is detected but trim it instead. So the file will be 0 length but kept in the file system. If you are 100% sure that all detected malicious files are not included into another files or database so you can uncheck this option and run <em>Cleanup</em>.</li><li><strong>Update antivirus database automatically</strong> It configures antivirus to update malware database automatically every day.

If the user selects to cleanup malware, then the antivirus either removes a piece of malicious injection in the file or removes the entire file depending on the detected threat.</p><p>If the entire file is a web-shell or doorway or some other type of malicious file, then antivirus removes it entirely. If there’s only a small injection at the beginning or at the end, or somewhere in the middle of the file, the exact malicious piece of code will be removed, but the rest content is left unchanged. Generally, the antivirus removes the malware and keeps a website up and running.</p><p>There’s an option in the settings which defines whether the file is to be removed or just truncated (content of the file is completely removed but the file itself is left on the file system empty and has zero file length).</p><p>The truncation is safer than removal because if the file is included in a database template or some other system file or a config file then the website might become broken after a cleanup. Therefore the antivirus uses a safer cleanup by default to keep the website working properly all the time. But one can disable this option in the Settings so the antivirus will remove the file completely in case the entire file is malware.</p><h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#faq">#</a> FAQ</h2><h3 id="does-imunifyav-protect-websites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#does-imunifyav-protect-websites">#</a> Does ImunifyAV protect websites?</h3><p>ImunifyAV is a comprehensive malware detection and removal tool.

Check it with the server administrator.</li><li>Malicious file was missed or not readable at the time of cleanup.</li><li>Malicious file is not in the cleanup database of the Antivirus. In this case you can see the <strong>Manual cleanup required</strong> status next to the file.
